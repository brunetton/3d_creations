# Spool holder

This is a spool holder using 608 bearings, inspired by many of already exiting ones, and particularly [this one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2165694).

The advantages of this one are:
  - no screw
  - simple assembly (3 different parts)
  - large base for stability

Little margins for printing inaccuracies correction are customizables using online `onshape` app.

## Customization

All offsets are pre-defined to work with my Anet A8, but it can be a little different on other printers.

- bearing outside <-> bearing enclosure: 0.275mm (that makes bearing enclosure ⌀22.55mm)
